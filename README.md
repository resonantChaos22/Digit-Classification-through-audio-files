# Digit-Classification-through-audio-files
There are 2000 audio files in which 4 people have spoken a digit in a file 50 times.
I created training set of 3 persons and the test set of the fourth person.
I converted the audi file into 128 mfc constants and then feeded the array(tensor) into a neural network with two hidden layers.

The data is taken from https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset
